# Braingeneers Python Utilities

[This package][github] is supposed to collect, as well as make installable
through Pip, all of the Python code and utilities that we develop as
part of the Braingeneers project. There are two subpackages:
  * `braingeneers.datasets` contains methods which load data from the PRP.
  * `braingeneers.drylab` contains all the simulation code.
