# Braingeneers Python Utilities

[This package][github] is supposed to collect, as well as make installable
through Pip, all of the Python code and utilities that we develop as
part of the Braingeneers project. There are five subpackages:
  * `braingeneers.analysis` contains code for data analysis.
  * `braingeneers.datasets_electrophysiology` contains methods which load and manipulate ephys data.
  * `braingeneers.datasets_fluidics` contains methods which load and manipulate fluidics data.
  * `braingeneers.datasets_imaging` contains methods which load and manipulate imaging data.
  * `braingeneers.drylab` contains code for neuronal simulations.
  * `braingeneers.utils.messaging` a single interface for all messaging and data transfer functions (MQTT, redis, device state, etc.)
