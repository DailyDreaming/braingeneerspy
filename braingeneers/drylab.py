class Organoid():
    """
    A simulated 2D culture of cortical cells using models from
    Dynamical Systems in Neuroscience, with synapses implemented as
    exponential PSPs for both excitatory and inhibitory cells.

    The model represents the excitability of a neuron using three
    phase variables: the membrane voltage v : mV, the "recovery" or
    "leakage" current u : pA, and the synaptic activation at each
    cell, a unitless A.

    The synapses in the updated model are conductance-type, with
    synaptic conductance following the alpha function of the synaptic
    actiavtion times the peak conductance G[i,j]. This adds another
    parameter to each cell: the Nernst reversal potential Vn of its
    neurotransmitter. Synaptic activation pulls the membrane voltage
    of the postsynaptic cell towards the reversal potential of the
    presynaptic cell.

    Additionally, the excitation model contains the following static
    parameters, on a per cell basis by providing arrays of size (N,):
     a : 1/ms time constant of recovery current
     b : nS steady-state conductance for recovery current
     c : mV membrane voltage after a downstroke
     d : pA bump to recovery current after a downstroke
     C : pF membrane capacitance
     k : nS/mV voltage-gated Na+ channel conductance
     Vr: mV resting membrane voltage when u=0
     Vt: mV threshold voltage when u=0
     Vp: mV action potential peak, after which reset happens
     Vn: mV Nernst potential of the cell's neurotransmitter
    tau: ms time constant for synaptic activation

    Finally, there is an optional triplet STDP rule for unsupervised
    learning, from Pfister and Gerstner, J. Neurosci. 26(38):9673.
    An arbitrary weight maximum has been introduced, but the proper
    way to do this is through synaptic scaling or homeostatic
    modulation of intrinsic excitability (TODO).

    The default parameters for STDP are taken from the same source,
    which derived them from a fit to V1 data recorded by SjostrÃ¶m.

        Wraps an Organoid with easier initialization and timestepping
        for machine learning applications. An Organoid with N cells is
        constructed; this has been tested mostly at N=1000, so if you
        have a different number of inputs, use an input matrix that
        assigns each input to a random subset of neurons.

        Inputs are prescaled to convert from unitless values to
        currents; the default value of 200 is tuned towards inputs in
        the range (0,1). Additionally, random noise is added to the
        input before injecting it to the Organoid, with SNR=noise.

        Simulations are run with the timestep dt, and you can select
        whether to use the torch backend and whether to attempt to
        ``learn'' using STDP by passing keyword arguments.
